Car Accidents and Deaths by Alcohol Dataset
Overview
This dataset contains information about individuals involved in car accidents and deaths related to alcohol consumption. The data includes demographic details, education levels, and whether the individual was involved in a car accident or death by alcohol. The dataset aims to provide insights into the correlation between demographic factors and the incidence of alcohol-related car accidents and fatalities.
Data Description
The dataset contains the following columns:
•	Age: The age of the individual.
•	Gender: The gender of the individual (Male/Female).
•	Education Level: The highest level of education attained by the individual.
•	Car Accidents: A binary indicator (Yes/No) showing whether the individual has been involved in a car accident.
•	Deaths by Alcohol: A binary indicator (Yes/No) showing whether the individual has died due to alcohol-related incidents.
Column Details
•	Age: Numeric value representing the age of the individual.
•	Gender: Categorical value with possible entries: Male, Female.
•	Education Level: Categorical value with possible entries: High School, College, Graduate.
•	Car Accidents: Binary value indicating car accident involvement: Yes (involved), No (not involved).
•	Deaths by Alcohol: Binary value indicating alcohol-related death: Yes (deceased), No (not deceased).
Sample Data
Age	Gender	Education Level	Car Accidents	Deaths by Alcohol
25	Male	High School	Yes	No
42	Female	College	No	No
35	Male	Graduate	Yes	Yes
50	Female	High School	No	No
28	Male	College	Yes	No
Objectives
The main objectives of analyzing this dataset are:
1.	Demographic Analysis:
•	Determine the distribution of individuals based on age, gender, and education level.
2.	Incident Analysis:
•	Calculate the number of car accidents and deaths by alcohol in the dataset.
3.	Correlation Analysis:
•	Investigate the correlation between demographic factors (age, gender, education level) and the likelihood of being involved in car accidents or alcohol-related deaths.
4.	Risk Assessment:
•	Assess the risk factors associated with car accidents and alcohol-related deaths.
5.	Policy Implications:
•	Provide insights for policymakers to design targeted interventions to reduce car accidents and alcohol-related fatalities.
Analytical Approach
1. Data Cleaning
Before performing any analysis, ensure the data is clean:
•	Check for and handle missing values.
•	Ensure data types are appropriate for each column.
•	Standardize categorical values (e.g., ensure gender values are consistently labeled).
2. Descriptive Statistics
Calculate basic statistics to understand the distribution of data:
•	Mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for the Age column.
•	Frequency counts for Gender and Education Level columns.
•	Count of Car Accidents and Deaths by Alcohol.
3. Correlation Analysis
Use statistical methods to analyze correlations:
•	Chi-square tests for categorical data.
•	Pearson correlation coefficient for numerical data.
4. Visualization
Visualize the data to uncover patterns and trends:
•	Bar charts for gender and education level distributions.
•	Pie charts for the proportion of car accidents and deaths by alcohol.
•	Scatter plots to show the relationship between age and the likelihood of incidents.
