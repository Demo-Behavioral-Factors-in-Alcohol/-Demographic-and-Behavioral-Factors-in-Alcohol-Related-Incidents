    <h1>Car Accidents and Deaths by Alcohol Dataset</h1>
    <p>This dataset contains information about individuals involved in car accidents and deaths related to alcohol consumption. The data includes demographic details, education levels, and whether the individual was involved in a car accident or death by alcohol. The dataset aims to provide insights into the correlation between demographic factors and the incidence of alcohol-related car accidents and fatalities.</p>

    <h2>Data Description</h2>
    <p>The dataset contains the following columns:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> The age of the individual.</li>
        <li><strong>Gender:</strong> The gender of the individual (Male/Female).</li>
        <li><strong>Education Level:</strong> The highest level of education attained by the individual.</li>
        <li><strong>Car Accidents:</strong> A binary indicator (Yes/No) showing whether the individual has been involved in a car accident.</li>
        <li><strong>Deaths by Alcohol:</strong> A binary indicator (Yes/No) showing whether the individual has died due to alcohol-related incidents.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Column Details</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> Numeric value representing the age of the individual.</li>
        <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Categorical value with possible entries: Male, Female.</li>
        <li><strong>Education Level:</strong> Categorical value with possible entries: High School, College, Graduate.</li>
        <li><strong>Car Accidents:</strong> Binary value indicating car accident involvement: Yes (involved), No (not involved).</li>
        <li><strong>Deaths by Alcohol:</strong> Binary value indicating alcohol-related death: Yes (deceased), No (not deceased).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>The main objectives of analyzing this dataset are:</p>
    <h3>1. Demographic Analysis:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Determine the distribution of individuals based on age, gender, and education level.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2. Incident Analysis:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Calculate the number of car accidents and deaths by alcohol in the dataset.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3. Correlation Analysis:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Investigate the correlation between demographic factors (age, gender, education level) and the likelihood of being involved in car accidents or alcohol-related deaths.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>4. Risk Assessment:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Assess the risk factors associated with car accidents and alcohol-related deaths.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>5. Policy Implications:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide insights for policymakers to design targeted interventions to reduce car accidents and alcohol-related fatalities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Analytical Approach</h2>
    <h3>1. Data Cleaning</h3>
    <p>Before performing any analysis, ensure the data is clean:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Check for and handle missing values.</li>
        <li>Ensure data types are appropriate for each column.</li>
        <li>Standardize categorical values (e.g., ensure gender values are consistently labeled).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Descriptive Statistics</h3>
    <p>Calculate basic statistics to understand the distribution of data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for the Age column.</li>
        <li>Frequency counts for Gender and Education Level columns.</li>
        <li>Count of Car Accidents and Deaths by Alcohol.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Correlation Analysis</h3>
    <p>Use statistical methods to analyze correlations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chi-square tests for categorical data.</li>
        <li>Pearson correlation coefficient for numerical data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Visualization</h3>
    <p>Visualize the data to uncover patterns and trends:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bar charts for gender and education level distributions.</li>
        <li>Pie charts for the proportion of car accidents and deaths by alcohol.</li>
        <li>Scatter plots to show the relationship between age and the likelihood of incidents.</li>
    </ul>
